# SavingSpendingApp

Project that I came up with because I though it might be interesting to do and need and app for Managing finances with my girlfriend.<br>
Here you can Find deployed app: https://makarontoja.pythonanywhere.com/ - For now there is no security so basically anyone can use it for own purposes.<br>
Apps main fetures which is to allow to add savings in multiple currencies and share some accounts with other users.<br>
It will be implemented to add Spendings and those Spendings will update balance in Savings.<br>
Those are urls you can use:<br>
savings/ - list of all savings<br>
savings/add/ - add new saving<br>
accounts/login/ - login to your account<br>
accounts/logout/ - logout from account<br>
accounts/register/ - register new account<br>
<br>
Application has a simple GUI which should work fine for mobile devices.<br>
