# SavingSpendingApp

Project that I came up with because I though it might be interesting to do and need and app for Managing finances with my girlfriend.\n
Here you can Find deployed app: https://makarontoja.pythonanywhere.com/ - For now there is no security so basically anyone can use it for own purposes
Apps main fetures which is to allow to add savings in multiple currencies and share some accounts with other users.
It will be implemented to add Spendings and those Spendings will update balance in Savings.
Those are urls you can use:
savings/ - list of all savings
savings/add/ - add new saving
accounts/login/ - login to your account
accounts/logout/ - logout from account
accounts/register/ - register new account

Application has a simple GUI which should work fine for mobile devices.
